The forking and cloning process, but that was just the basics.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here]
Well, first step is always the hardest, since we were just giving a brand new group (20) and we are missing one team member's input since she didn't come to class last week.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here]
More time in class maybe Q/A and examples for the final project.
